# Sample Burp Suite extension: Hello World

Our first sample extension is about as basic as things can get, while actually
doing something. It demonstrates the following techniques:
- Setting the name of the extension, which will be shown to the user in the UI.
- Obtaining the extension-specific output and error streams.
- Writing messages to the output and error streams.
- Writing a message to the main Burp alerts log.
- Generating an exception to demonstrate how this is reported to the user.

This repository includes source code for Java, Python and Ruby.
